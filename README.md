## Project Overview

We created a console-based Inventory Management System in Python for a fictional company called Micro Circuits. The system is designed to help the company efficiently manage their stock by tracking stock codes, prices, and item counts. The program provides essential features such as adding new stock codes, updating item quantities, searching for specific items, and displaying the full inventory with calculated values.

The entire solution is implemented in a single Python file and is navigated through a user-friendly CLI menu.

## Features

- **Add Stock Code**  
  Prompts the user to enter a new stock code and its price. Ensures that the total number of stock types does not exceed 50 and that no item is priced above R1000.00.

- **Search for Stock Code**  
  Efficiently searches for a stock code in the system and returns its index if found.

- **Add Stock Item**  
  Allows the user to increase the quantity of a specific stock item. Ensures that no item exceeds a stock count of 100.

- **Display Stock List**  
  Displays all stock codes with their current quantity, price, and total value. Also shows the overall total value of all stock.

- **Menu-Driven CLI**  
  A loop-based command-line menu that remains active until the user chooses to exit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
  The entire application is developed using standard Python 3 without any external libraries. The focus is on core programming logic, input/output handling, and list-based data structures.
